## Introduction

**The problem**

Public art is an important aspect of any city as it reflects the culture, history, and values of a community. Vancouver is known for its vibrant and diverse arts scene, and as a result, it has a plethora of public art installations that locals and tourists can explore. However, apart from some well-known museums that gather art collections together, with so many public art installations scattered throughout the city, it can be difficult for tourists to find the art they are interested in. As a result, we want to provide tourists with a centralized location to find information on public art in Vancouver.

**The solution**

Our `VanArt` dashboard provides a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that allows tourists to easily find the public art they are interested in. By providing information on the location, the artists, year of installation, etc. our dashboard will not only help tourists find the public art they are looking for but also provide context and background on each installation. Additionally, `VanArt` can serve as a tool to promote public art and encourage people to explore Vancouver. Overall, `VanArt` has the potential to enhance the experience of tourists visiting Vancouver by providing them with a unique and enriching way to explore the city's public art. Although geared towards tourists, `VanArt` can be used by anyone interested in the Vancouver public art scene; locals who would like to explore their cityâ€™s public art are welcome to and encouraged to use `VanArt`.
