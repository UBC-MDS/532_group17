## Introduction

**Application Description and Schematic**

Our application will contain three different panels, all centered around a map of Vancouver displaying the locations of the public art. When first opening the application (without any user input) the map will display all the art icons. As the user selects options on the left hand panel, they will filter down the art icons visible on the map. The panel on the left will include the year(s) when the art was installed, the type (or category) of art (mural, sculpture etc.), the artist name, and the neighbourhood of interest. The user can also interact with the map directly, when they select an icon of interest, a panel will appear providing the user all the details about that particular public art piece (including the name of the work, an image of it, the artist name, its address and finally a website link with more information about the art). Finally, the panel on the right hand side will show the user some basic statistics to accompany the map, based on the filtered criteria the user entered in the left most panel. This panel will include a bar chart to show the number of art pieces against the year installed, a pie chart to show the types of art, and a density graph to show areas where most of the art is found.
