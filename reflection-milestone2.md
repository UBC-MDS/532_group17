### What we have done so far?

To date, we have built the majority of the dashboard to align with our mock-up. We have
created all our visualizations (with updates) and our interactive elements.

We had to modify our code for the pie plot shown on the mock up as this did not
do a good job displaying the variety of art types, and opted to do a tree plot instead. 


### What is yet to be implemented?
We opted to not include the artist data at this time, as it required a lot more data 
wrangling that initially anticipated. We hope to update this in the next iteration. 
We also hope to update our set-up to include tabs so that you can see the graphs
more clearly and not have it stuck together on the side of the page. We also hope to add
finer elements such as a color theme.
