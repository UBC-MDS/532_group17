# Proposal
## Motivation and Purpose
Our Role: Travel Advising Team
Target Audience: Tourists in Vancouver

Public art is an important aspect of any city as it reflects the culture, history, and values of a community. Vancouver is known for its vibrant and diverse arts scene, and as a result, it has a plethora of public art installations that locals and tourists can explore. However, apart from some well-known museums that gather art collections together, with so many public art installations scattered throughout the city, it can be difficult for tourists to find the art they are interested in. As a result, we want to provide tourists with a centralized location for people to find information on public art in Vancouver.
