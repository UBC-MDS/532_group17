### What we have done so far?

*Improvements implemented in Milestone 4*

1. We added a `navbarPage` panel to create a "Dashboard" page which holds our main dashboard, and an "About" page which gives the user information about our dashboard. 

### What are limitations of our dashboard? 

### What is yet to be implemented?

---

### Has it been easy to use our app?

### Are there reoccurring themes in your feedback on what is good and what can be improved?

### Is there any feedback (or other insight) that you have found particularly valuable during your dashboard development?
