He didn't strike it rich and instead became a tax man and a steamboat pilot and later ran a saloon which is why he stands on a whiskey barrel. The Globe Saloon which stood on the site was reputedly built in 24 hours by the thirsty workers. (Vancouver Sun, April 7, 2001, H3) The nickname Gassy Jack came from the fact that he talked so much.

Cement and wood planks are interspersed with grass to create a walkway underneath the overhead track. The planks are reminiscent of a winding keyboard. The overhead track ends at the False Creek side with a row of 5 wooden barrels lined up like on an assembly line. Below the barrels is a board walk of 12 segments. Stepping on each board distinctly will cause steam to be forced through the barrels and out one side, creating a sound like a calliope on which you can play a tune. The sound harkens back to other times in relation to the contemporary sounds of the city which surround the piece. <br> <br> <b>Address<\/b>:  1033 Marinaside Crescent <br> <b>Year installed<\/b>:  2002 <br> <b>Photo:<\/b><br><img src=' https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/cc77ece99dc24e6e086af0401fd71460 ' style='max-width:200px; max-height:200px;'><br>",

The sculpture consists of a 15' square of corten steel. Each side of the square is 15' long by 3'  high by 3' wide. The bottom side appears to be cut apart in the middle and the two parts wrenched apart to form a gate or arch.  The corten steel is designed so that the surface rust forms a protective coating.  There was some adverse reaction from Kits Point residents when the work was installed. Michael Duncan, Chief Curator of the Maritime Museum at the time, called it \"a bloody monstrosity.\" An article in the Globe and Mail teased that it could be \"the world's largest paper clip.\" The article (Mar3, 1981) also quoted from a city planning study which read: \"Vancouver's peerless natural setting is a permanent gift from nature. So massive and close are the North Shore mountains that no amount of human folly can ever obliterate them.\"  But the controversy soon abated and the piece has weathered time and opinion. It was vandalized on July 4th, 1988, when a field of white dots were painted on its surfaces -probably as an art \"intervention\". The dots were soon removed. Since then, the \"Gate to the Northwest Passage\" has become a familiar landmark, an important place marker which stands guard at the entrance to False Creek.

                "<b>Title of work<\/b>:  Geyser for Hillcrest Park <br> <b>Type of art<\/b>:  Fountain or water feature <br> <b>Description<\/b>:  There have long been rumours of underground water at the Hillcrest site, but Hillcrest Geyser arises from other hidden sources and pressures – the infrastructure of the new “green” water recycling system in the building. This public artwork is inspired by Old Faithful and other natural water spouts arising from geological pressures under the earth’s surface. \r\n\r\nA natural geyser is a spectacle that brings attention to what is going on below the surface of things. As a public monument, Geyser for Hillcrest Park replicates this sense of wonder and acts as a spontaneous reminder of underlying forces at work on the site. It is a civic “natural wonder” that makes the green initiatives of the building apparent for all to see. It is not a fountain that operates with a recycling pump. The Geyser acts according to the rhythms and needs of the community, as evidenced by the levels and flow of water through the site. The geyser spray is around 15 feet in height. The duration of the spray is determined by the amount of water needed to fill the tank. The run-off from the Geyser is connected to the grey water cistern in the Hillcrest facility. This cistern is used for all the building’s non-potable water needs, including flushing toilets and irrigation throughout the park grounds. The cistern is fed by collected rainwater from the roof and some grey water from underground sources. However, when the water in the cistern is low, it draws on the city’s drinkable water supply. This is where the Geyser comes in. It is incorporated into this water “loop\" so that clean potable water needed to top up the cistern will first be propelled out through the Geyser and then flow back to the cistern as grey water. <br> <br> <b>Address<\/b>:  NA <br> <b>Year installed<\/b>:  2012 <br> <b>Photo:<\/b><br><img src=' https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/0356343bf7fa340cc9591aefafa06bd6 ' style='max-width:200px; max-height:200px;'><br>",
                "<b>Title of work<\/b>:  SeeSawSeat <br> <b>Type of art<\/b>:  Sculpture <br> <b>Description<\/b>:  SeeSawSeat is a public artwork by Germaine Koh that crosses a bus bench with a teeter-totter. Waiting for the bus is transformed from a passive pause into a modest social activity. Made of wood and metal and resembling the benches in Vancouver's bus shelters, the artwork is located in close proximity to an existing transit shelter with an integral bench making the visual references clear.A transit bench as teeter-totter creates a playful situation full of possibilities for interaction and negotiation. Uncomfortable when used by only one person, the artwork is best experienced with another person and thus becomes a tool for whimsical social exchange.SeeSawSeat is built with the fulcrum of the bench slighly to one side, so that when then bence is unoccupied, it drops to one side, a clear sign that it is not a fixed bench. The highest point of teh 8-foot-long bench is approximately 28\" above grade when fully tilted.SeeSawSeat was one of three public art projects developed through the Main Street Urban Transportation Showcase (UTS), a plan to encourage reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and more energy efficient transportation practices by improving pedestrian and transit services along Main Street. As part of the Main Street UTS, an art plan was created which led to the commissioning of three public art projects to be installed in the Main Street corridor, including temporary artworks for three Main Street articulated trolley buses. Artists were selected by a panel consisting of three art professionals, and one representative each from Translink and City of Vancouver.This artwork is part of a transit and corridor improvement project and funding partnership between Translink, the City of Vancouver and the Federal Government <br> <br> <b>Address<\/b>:  NA <br> <b>Year installed<\/b>:  2018 <br> <b>Photo:<\/b><br><img src=' https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/39f802ee363cd032abd4f7981e99d888 ' style='max-width:200px; max-height:200px;'><br>",

The artwork title “RGB” refers to the additive model of reproducing colours with light (red, green, and blue). The three colours can also be seen to symbolize the Trinity. A fritted glass pattern comprised of over 1,000 crosses on each large panel of glass are repeated across the windows of the church facility. Nine different intuitive arrangements of crosses, three arrangements for each of the three colours, create an overall, organic, swarming pattern.

                "<b>Title of work<\/b>:  Flow <br> <b>Type of art<\/b>:  Site-integrated work <br> <b>Description<\/b>:  Flow is Vancouver&#39;s first photo/media-based permanent public art work. A daily Flow concept developed by Fiona Bowie and Sidney Fels, based on using various components, such as time of day and weather, partially influences the behaviour of how images in the work appear. A system custom-designed by Bowie and Sidney Fels with Morgan Hibbert allows figures shot at different times to appear as if they are simultaneously present with a core group of these figures or actors recurring in a manner that implicitly suggests they&#39;re part of a larger narrative. Over the course of the day and night, Flow shifts between live and constructed or theatrical tableaus. During the early morning and after dusk Flow presents as a continuously changing tableau in which hundreds of photographic portraits and landscapes, shot by Fiona Bowie over a number of years, are blended and projected onto a special projection material, switch glass. As viewers come close to the image, the switch glass causes portions of the imagery to disappear as the surface of the glass panels &#39;switch&#39; from translucent to clear.  The scenes in Flow change every two to four minutes. The transitions from one scene to another are so slow that the work has been described as having a dream-like or hallucinatory quality. Because the projection system constantly varies the scale of images (between life size and zoomed in), a particular shot of a particular character may vary from scene to scene, seemingly either fore-grounded or backgrounded. During daylight hours, Flow&#39;s dynamic glass projection surface creates viewing portals, framing details of the activity inside and outside. This provides individuals inside with shifting views and details of the street (these views change according to their proximity to the street) and passersby are able to view activity going on inside the building.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\n\r\n\r\n\\tDeveloped Daily Flow concept (crows, weather): Fiona Bowie, Sidney Fels\r\n\\tInitial daily flow concept: Fiona Bowie, Sidney Fels, with Rebecca Belmore\r\n\\tPhotography and moving image, locations: Fiona Bowie\r\n\\tImage selection, Editing, Photography Post: Fiona Bowie\r\n\\tPortrait/Character/friend Diegesis: Fiona Bowie\r\n\\tSystem design: Sidney Fels, Fiona Bowie, Morgan Hibbert\r\n\\tCoding: Morgan Hibbert and Sidney Fels\r\n\\tSlow transitions, disappearing image/ switchglass concepts: Fiona Bowie\r\n\\tWebsite concept: Fiona Bowie \r\n\\tWebsite markup and design: Fiona Bowie \r\n\\tPut words in our mouths archive: Kay Higgins\r\n\\tProject and crew management: Fiona Bowie\r\n\\tLive switchglass execution and cam: Sidney Fels, Morgan Hibbert <br> <br> <b>Address<\/b>:  1 Kingsway <br> <b>Year installed<\/b>:  2009 <br> <b>Photo:<\/b><br><img src=' https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/26ce4c6a39adcf177bd9a04e5a3590b5 ' style='max-width:200px; max-height:200px;'><br>",

One of Musqueam’s most sacred sites, the Great Fraser Midden, is located just south of this site.\r\n\r\nThe sculpture was conceived by the artist to acknowledge this rich cultural history, the history of the Coast Salish people, and to (re)introduce the residents of this community to their neighbour ~ the Musqueam people.\r\n\r\nThe 14’ high water-jet cut aluminum sculpture, powder coated in copper and silver paint, is a contemporary Coast Salish design depicting salmon and river grass, which are representative of the Coast Salish people, and the Musqueam people in particular, and the salmon, once found in abundance in the nearby Fraser River. <br> <br> <b>Address<\/b>:  70th Avenue & Cornish Street <br> <b>Year installed<\/b>:  2014 <br> <b>Photo:<\/b><br><img src=' https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/c30f3bbc5f70d8a7407ca6303c97ed49 ' style='max-width:200px; max-height:200px;'><br>",

Each light box is shaped as a fragment of a circle,  the shape of a spindle whorl which was utilized when spinning the yarn used in Coast Salish weaving.  (Examples of Musqueam weaving can be seen in the display case in front of the Safeway store along Granville street).  \r\n\r\nCreations in weaving have been passed down for countless generations.  The artists’ grandmother, Edna Grant, was taught to weave by her mother, who was taught by her mother, and so on. Her designs could be recognized up and down the coast.

As 'play-sculptures' that combine modernist sculpture, mid-century playground designs, and monochrome patterns, these sensuous organic forms will invite a more physical engagement than is normally allowed with public art, providing occasions for children, families, and staff to play. The vision of the artists is to engage audiences of all ages and abilities with the sculptures' tactile qualities and lift their spirits with their humour and playfulness, creating a transition zone between the everyday and the extraordinary.Playtime is originally inspired by the 'play-sculptures' of English sculptor John Bridgeman (1916-2004) and Danish architect and sculptor Egon Moller-Nielsen (1915-1959), the work of Henry Moore, and two female artists, Barbara Hepworth (1903-1975) and Bridget Riley (1931-present), all of whom were producing works around the same time. <br> <br> <b>Address<\/b>:  4480 Oak Street <br> <b>Year installed<\/b>:  2016 <br> <b>Photo:<\/b><br><img src=' https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/cd20c9d049c50b8cee9d13a18d835dd5 ' style='max-width:200px; max-height:200px;'><br>",

Drawing on broad references of horizon lines and landscape art, Lee enables passers-by to visualize the wind.Building on a sense of theatricality, Lee’s installation acts as an elaborate set composed of three-dimensional objects that cast larger-than-life shadows againstan enormous backdrop. Red, Green and Blue draws viewers into the intersections of artifice and nature with an abundant field of transparent cones fabricated from sheets of hand-folded plastic film. It is both painting and sculpture, using light filtered hrough red, green and blue lighting gels to project an immersive field of coloured, grass-like forms on the architecture of Offsite.Although an oasis literally refers to the greenery within a desert, it also describes a peaceful location or imagined place where one might escape the rigours of everyday life. Lee’s oasis unfolds into an array of colourful and contemplative possibilities that break up the monotony of grey surroundings. <br> <br> <b>Address<\/b>:  1128 West Georgia Street <br> <b>Year installed<\/b>:  2016 <br> <b>Photo:<\/b><br><img src=' https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/e0b21012055e192f4473391dffe67c5a ' style='max-width:200px; max-height:200px;'><br>",

The public art is part of the City’s ongoing commitment to reconciliation and strengthening of relations between Indigenous communities and Vancouverites.The murals, banners and transparencies were commissioned as part of the City of Vancouver's commemoration of the sesquicentennial of Canada's confederation. Vancouver refocused the national celebration on its indigenous peoples and First Nations, who long precede confederation, and whose resurgence will continue long past the anniversary--hence \"150+\".The public art program issued a call for murals in January 2017. The six successful applicant teams were reviewed and chosen by a selection panel of Indigenous artists and art professionals.The projects were realized throughout the city centre, including projects at the central library, Queen Elizabeth Theatre and its plaza, the headhouse of a Canada Line station, a laneway on the Downtown Eastside, and the lot where the Kanata Fest and the Drum Is Calling Festival were held.Works variously drew from Coast Salish, formline, and Woodland School forms, presented portraits mixing contemporary and traditional clothing and regalia, and collaged photographic images into abstracted compositions.Commissioned in the spirit of Reconcilation, the project served to increase Indigenous visibility on the unceded territories of the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations now known as Vancouver. <br> <br> <b>Address<\/b>:  Georgia & Granville Street <br> <b>Year installed<\/b>:  2017 <br> <b>Photo:<\/b><br><img src=' https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/9a5782fa21b7bc7ecc93c0a144539a64 ' style='max-width:200px; max-height:200px;'><br>",

The initial concept for the sign came from viewing large driftwood logs tossed up on rocks along the beach near the Vancouver Maritime Museum. The large horizontal cedar log was cut from a tree blown down by strong winds in Stanley Park, salvaged and donated by the City of Vancouver. The log has been set onto boulders excavated from the old Carling O'Keefe Brewery site at 12th Avenue and Arbutus, and donated by Intergulf Development Group.The vertical log sculpture is composed of 3 layers of upright logs stepping up and back from the viewer. The first carving on the front set of logs portrays a Coast Salish village with cedar plank houses and beached canoes, a scene which may have been typical around this area prior to European settlement.The carving on the second layer of logs portrays past and present roots of Kitsilano, including a traditional corner store, craftsman-style houses, adn Engine 374, which pulled the first transcontinental train into Vancouver in 1887, was retired to Kitsilano Park for many years, and is now on display in the Roundhouse Community Centre. Also portrayed on this layer is the Vancouver Museum and Pacific Space Centre.The third layer of carved logs portrays a view north across English Bay to Stanley Park, Vancouver's West End, and the North Shore mountains - a scene which is typical from almost any viewpoint in the Kitsilano area.The sign was designed by Kitsilano resident Jim Kostyniuk and carved by BC artist Pete Ryan. The sign is an initiative of the Kitsilano Chamber of Commerce.

These timbers are set on end in a seemingly random pattern on six concrete pads in the middle of Granville Square and mostly enclosed within a 50 foot diameter circle of red tiles. The sculpture measures about 40 feet by 60 feet and is roughly in the shape of a cross.  Known as \"Phifer's Fountain\", this work was commissioned in 1973 by the CPR and Marathon Realty to address a plaza of which the zoning panel of the day said \"a truly `civic square', as the developers propose, should be more generous and festive in concept.\" (Rezoning application, October 1968) This plaza was described in the 1969 development permit application as \"developed with trees, sitting area, fountain, grass mounds, architectural lighting, etc.\" Somewhere along the line, the \"fountain\" turned into a 30 foot by 60 foot sculpture.\r\n\"The CPR went to Washington State to find someone to design these columns of squared timber to represent, in abstract form, BC forests. The wood used would supply enough timber to build 10 homes.\" (A Guide to Sculpture in Vancouver, Peggy Imredy, 1980)\r\nBy 2002, some of these columns had deteriorated substantially and Marathon wanted to redevelop the plaza. Some effort was made to find a new home for this quintessential 70s work, with the artist choosing to give it to the interior community of Princeton, where it currently stands as the gateway to the Trans Canada Trail. http://town.princeton.bc.ca/newpages/parksandrec/phifersfount.html# <br> <br> <b>Address<\/b>:  North end of Granville Street (Downtown) <br> <b>Year installed<\/b>:  1973 <br> <b>Photo:<\/b><br><img src=' https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/2a6d1a6194d935dee701b126429272ec ' style='max-width:200px; max-height:200px;'><br>",

                "<b>Title of work<\/b>:  Girl in Wetsuit <br> <b>Type of art<\/b>:  Sculpture <br> <b>Description<\/b>:  A life size bronze statue of a woman in a wetsuit, with flippers on her feet and her mask pushed up on her forehead, sits on a large intertidal boulder just offshore of Stanley Park. In September of 1968, Douglas Brown, a Vancouver lawyer, talked to sculptor Elek Imredy about his desire to commission a sculpture inspired by the famous Copenhagen mermaid, which could be sited on the great granite boulder just off the northern shore of Stanley Park. Imredy proposed a life-size bronze sculpture of a scuba diver. On Brown&#39;s initiative, the Vancouver Harbour Improvement Society was formed with the intention of financing and facilitating a unique landmark for both Vancouverites and visitors to the city. They raised the money to produce the sculpture privately and Imredy was commissioned to craft the proposed work. The Vancouver Park Board gave permission to the society to place the sculpture on the rock. Because the boulder was often covered at high tide, a precast concrete ring was created and the rock was lifted by a floating crane and set on the ring about 100 feet from its original location. Imredy first took a mold of the top surface of the rock. In his studio, he made a replica of the rock and modeled the figure in clay. Imredy asked his young friend Debra Harrington to model, however the sculpture is not recognizably her image. &quot;When I couldn&#39;t get the model to hold her hand the way I wanted it... I held my left hand in front of a mirror, showing its opposite, and I modeled right one. Of course, I made it a bit nicer, with longer fingers.&quot; A plaster of paris mold was made from the clay figure and the sculpture was cast in fibreglass. This fibreglass figure was flown to Rome where it was cast in bronze at Giovanni and Angelo Nicci&#39;s foundry. On June 9th, 1972, the sculpture was set in place by an electric crane reaching out from shore to the rock 80 feet away and fastened to the stone with stainless steel bolts. The next day the sculpture was ceremoniously unveiled. &quot;Girl in Wetsuit&quot; has become a landmark for visitors to Stanley Park and to boats that enter the harbour. <br> <br> <b>Address<\/b>:  Stanley Park <br> <b>Year installed<\/b>:  1972 <br> <b>Photo:<\/b><br><img src=' https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/5989caf97042374c9ae2bd7bcad2e57e ' style='max-width:200px; max-height:200px;'><br>",

The design was originally created in 1936 for the Sheet Metal Workers Local 280 float for the Pacific National Exhibition Jubilee Parade on the occasion of the City of Vancouver's 50th birthday. It was designed by Lew Parry and made into a sculpture, built by Neon Products, which was sited at the first Vancouver Air Terminal from 1939 to 1972 when it was scrapped because of rust. In 1985 the Vancouver Transportation Club and the Sheet Metal Workers Union 280 decided to build a replica to celebrate Vancouver's 100th birthday. They located Lew Parry and he still had the original plans. This time the rocketship was built from more durable materials by Terminal Sheet Metal and the Local 280 metal workers. The Rocket was exhibited at Expo 86 and then donated to the city. It was moved by helicopter to it's current site. A Centennial Time Capsule is housed in the base of the rocket, scheduled to be opened 50 years from 1986. It includes items such as an Expo 86 passport with stamps of all the pavilions and recorded messages from local celebrities and many other things.\r\nThe City accepted the Centennial Rocket and a site was found for it in the small plaza at the SW end of the Cambie Street bridge.  -information from the website of SMW280 <br> <br> <b>Address<\/b>:  Cambie Street <br> <b>Year installed<\/b>:  1986 <br> <b>Photo:<\/b><br><img src=' https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/328ce7beb3b0e91b2e4b2f7b43444daf ' style='max-width:200px; max-height:200px;'><br>",

As such, deaccessioning is a serious consideration requiring careful planning and adherence to the conditions set out in our Deaccession Policy.\r\n\r\nhttps://vancouver.ca/files/cov/PublicArt-DeaccessionGuidelines.pdf <br> <br> <b>Address<\/b>:  901 West Hastings Street <br> <b>Year installed<\/b>:  1998 <br> <b>Photo:<\/b><br><img src=' https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/08d8ef221c79bcd72cf29ef3cd198160 ' style='max-width:200px; max-height:200px;'><br>",

                "<b>Title of work<\/b>:  Milky Way <br> <b>Type of art<\/b>:  Mosaic <br> <b>Description<\/b>:  Integrated into the public walkway through the Lions Developement at 1300 West Georgia, is a plaza incorporating fibre optic lights, mosaic swirls, and 3 large bronze castings of cargo ships seen from above. The lights, which are at grade level, define constellations in the night sky. The colorful swirls represent other galaxies and deep space objects, and the boats allude both to the actual cargo ships found in Vancouver's harbour and to mankind's use of the stars as navigation tools.     \r\nKerr's sculpture was commissioned by the developer of the site after a competition sanctioned by the Vancouver Public Art Committee. It has been integrated into the public plaza/walkway that runs diagonally through the site from the corner of Alberni and Broughton to the corner of Jervis and Georgia.\r\nThe work addresses pedestrian traffic through the walkway both during the day and as a completely different experience at night. It also allows opportunities for viewing the work from above from suites in the towers and from neighbouring towers.\r\n\"Milky Way\" has four elements layered into the work. The first is 39 colorful mosaic spiral galaxies scattered across the site. The brilliantly colorful mosaic tiles stand in marked contrast to the second element, colored stone aggregate which has been laid down in large abstract fiels and which represent the \"cosmic sea\". The third element is 170 fibre optic point lights, in four different intensities, which represent the stars in 36 constellations. These \"stars\" are each set into a black granite star shaped tile and each constellation is further defined by lines of polished brass set into the aggregate. The last element is three large bronze castings of cargo ships, commonly seen in Vancouver's harbour - a fishing trawler, a tug and gravel barge, and a BC ferry - all seen from above.\r\nThis work is both public and private, it welcomes both day and night viewing (in some sense providing its own light), and it enhances both public space and the developer's concerns for place making and site harmony. \"Milky Way\" is a successful example of Vancouver's public art program which has emphasized \"site specific\" public art instead of traditional sculpture. <br> <br> <b>Address<\/b>:  1300 West Georgia <br> <b>Year installed<\/b>:  1999 <br> <b>Photo:<\/b><br><img src=' https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/51642c9a1a154120e95996a7c60caac9 ' style='max-width:200px; max-height:200px;'><br>",

                "<b>Title of work<\/b>:  Double Blind <br> <b>Type of art<\/b>:  Site-integrated work <br> <b>Description<\/b>:  Double Blind is a large-scale sculptural installation by Antonia Hirsch, commissioned for the atrium of the new Vancouver Community College’s Broadway Campus Phase One Expansion building. Spanning four stories of the building, Double Blind  translates a Snellen, or eye, chart into Braille by using dome mirrors in order to emulate the raised dots of Braille script.\r\n\r\nDome mirrors are endemic to public spaces and can be found in pedestrian underpasses, hospital corridors, and in commercial retail contexts. They are used for surveillance as well as for the prevention of collisions in pedestrian traffic flow. Public space is often highly contested since it must typically answer to the idealist demands of communal space while also satisfying the concerns for public safety that are frequently associated with control and surveillance. Like many atriums, the new Vancouver Community College’s interior public space has a panoptic tendency: emphasizing ‘insight’ into various interior spaces from specific vantage points. This panoptic tendency is echoed in the domed mirrors, each reflecting a 360° view of the surrounding space.\r\n\r\nDouble Blind deliberately and emphatically utilizes elements that are commonly found in public space and re-purposes them, thereby highlighting the quality of the space itself, rather than offering a pictorial escape from its reality. Double Blind queries the interlinked ideas of seeing and controlling, acknowledging the importance of the context in which information is acquired and processed, whether that context is a scientific doctrine, social matrix, or language system.\r\n\r\nThis sculptural work is accompanied by a T-shirt multiple that echoes the installation’s oxymoronic premise: those who can see the work likely don’t read braille, and those who read braille can probably not see the work.\r\n\r\nOn the back of each T-shirt, an eye chart is rendered in raised letters. Though reproduced in a colour identical to that of the shirt and thereby nearly invisible, the characters are tangible. Conversely, the front of each shirt mirrors the installation’s graphic arrangement in reflective foil, yet these braille dots are entirely two-dimensional, visible, but not available through touch. <br> <br> <b>Address<\/b>:  1120 East 7th Avenue <br> <b>Year installed<\/b>:  2008 <br> <b>Photo:<\/b><br><img src=' https://opendata.vancouver.ca/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/public-art/files/7b84f85de4210b0e0eef8abd08895493 ' style='max-width:200px; max-height:200px;'><br>",

Nearly all of the electrical components had reached the end of their life expectancy. More importantly, restoration and reconfiguring costs were determined to be significantly higher than the original budget when factoring in repositioning expenses that would be required due to upcoming changes to the plaza.\r\n\r\nThe City of Vancouver strives to acquire and commission works of art of the highest quality. Acquisition by the City implies a commitment to the preservation, protection and maintenance of artwork for the public benefit and implies permanency within the collection.
